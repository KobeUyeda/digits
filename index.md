meteor-application-template-react is a sample Meteor 2.9 application that illustrates: 

  * A standard directory layout using 'imports/' as recommended in the [Meteor Guide](https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html)
  * [Bootstrap 5 React](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for user interface.
  * [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for form development.
  * [alanning:roles](https://github.com/alanning/meteor-roles) to implement a special "Admin" user.
  * Authorization, authentication, and registration using built-in Meteor packages.
  * Initialization of users and data from a settings file.
  * Alerts regarding success or failure of DB updates using [Sweet Alert](https://sweetalert.js.org/).
  * Quality assurance using [ESLint](http://eslint.org) with packages to partially enforce the [Meteor Coding Standards](https://guide.meteor.com/code-style.html) and the [AirBnB Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

The goal of this template is to help you get quickly started doing Meteor development by providing a reasonable directory structure for development and deployment, a set of common extensions to the core framework, and boilerplate code to implement basic page display, navigation, forms, roles, and collection manipulation.

To keep this codebase simple and small, some important capabilities are intentionally excluded from this template:

  * Unit Testing.
  * Security (meteor-application-template-react enables the insecure packages)
  * Deployment

Examples of the these capabilities will be provided elsewhere.

## Installation

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, go to [https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react), and click the "Use this template" button. Complete the dialog box to create a new repository that you own that is initialized with this template's files.

Third, go to your newly created repository, and click the "Clone or download" button to download your new GitHub repo to your local file system.  Using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a great choice if you use MacOS or Windows.

Fourth, cd into the app/ directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

## Running the system

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application by invoking the "start" script in the [package.json file](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/master/app/package.json):

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

The first time you run the app, it will create some default users and data. Here is the output:

```
 meteor npm run start

> meteor --no-release-check --exclude-archs web.browser.legacy,web.cordova --settings ../config/settings.development.json

```

Periodically, you might see `Error starting Mongo (2 tries left): Cannot run replSetReconfig because the node is currently updating its configuration` after the `=> Started HMR server.`. It doesn't seem to be a problem since the MongoDB does start.

### Viewing the running app

If all goes well, the template application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  You can login using the credentials in [settings.development.json](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/main/config/settings.development.json), or else register a new account.

### ESLint

You can verify that the code obeys our coding standards by running ESLint over the code in the imports/ directory with:

```
meteor npm run lint
```

## Walkthrough

The following sections describe the major features of this template.

### Directory structure

The top-level directory structure is:

```
.github     # holds the GitHub Continuous Integration action and Issue template.
app/        # holds the Meteor application sources
config/     # holds configuration files, such as settings.development.json
doc/        # holds developer documentation, user guides, etc.
.gitignore  # don't commit IntelliJ project files, node_modules, and settings.production.json
```

This structure separates documentation files (such as screenshots) and configuration files (such as the settings files) from the actual Meteor application.

The app/ directory has this structure:

```
.deploy/
  .gitignore     # don't commit mup.js or settings.json
  mup.sample.js  # sample mup.js file used for deploying the application
  settings.sample.json # sample settings file
  
client/
  main.html      # The boilerplate HTML with a "root" div to be manipulated by React.
  main.js        # import startup files.

imports/
  api/           # Define collections
    stuff/       # The Stuffs collection definition
  startup/       # Define code to run when system starts up (client-only, server-only, both)
    client/
    server/
  ui/
    components/  # Contains page elements, some of which could appear on multiple pages.
    layouts/     # Contains top-level layout (<App> component).
    pages/       # Contains components for each page.

node_modules/    # managed by npm

public/          # static assets (like images) can go here.

server/
   main.js       # import the server-side js files.
   
tests/           # testcafe acceptance tests.
```

### Import conventions

This system adheres to the Meteor guideline of putting all application code in the imports/ directory, and using client/main.js and server/main.js to import the code appropriate for the client and server in an appropriate order.

### Application functionality

The application implements a simple CRUD application for managing "Stuff", which is a Mongo Collection consisting of a name (String), a quantity (Number), a condition (one of 'excellent', 'good', 'fair', or 'poor') and an owner.

By default, each user only sees the Stuff that they have created.  However, the settings file enables you to define default accounts.  If you define a user with the role "admin", then that user gets access to a special page which lists all the Stuff defined by all users.

#### Landing page

When you first bring up the application, you will see the landing page that provides a brief introduction to the capabilities of Digits:

The next step is to use the Login menu to either Login to an existing account or register a new account.

#### Login page

Click on the Login link, then click on the Signin link to bring up the Sign In page which allows you to login:

<img width="620px" src="./doc/signin.png">

#### Register page

If you do not yet have an account on the system, you can register by clicking on “Login”, then “Sign Up”:

<img width="620px" src="./doc/signin.png">


#### Landing (after Login) page, non-Admin user

After successfully logging in, the system takes you to your home page. It is just like the landing page, but the NavBar contains links to list contact and add new contacts:

<img width="620px" src="./doc/user-home.png">

#### List Contact page

Clicking on the List Contacts link brings up a page that lists all of the contacts associated with the logged in user:

<img width="620px" src="./doc/list-contact.png">

This page also allows the user to add timestamped “notes” detailing interactions they’ve had with the Contact. For example:

#### Edit Contact page

From the List Contacts page, the user can click the “Edit” link associated with any Contact to bring up a page that allows that Contact information to be edited:

<img width="620px" src="./doc/edit-contact.png">

#### Admin page (list all users stuff)

It is possible to designate one or more users as “Admins” through the settings file. When a user has the Admin role, they get access to a special NavBar link that retrieves a page listing all Contacts associated with all users:
